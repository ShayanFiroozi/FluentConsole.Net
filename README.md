**FastLog.Net** is the fastest , most efficient and high performance logger for **.Net** 
 
‚úî Easy to use and develop , clean code , extensible agents and log model , and also designed to be fully thread-safe.  
 
‚úî FastLog.Net supports structured logging and enhanced Json format for [**Exception**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception?view=net-7.0) class.  
 
‚úî FastLog.Net uses thread-safe queueing technique to enqueue the logging request(s) and release your thread  
 ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇalmost immediately after you call a logging method.  
 
‚úî FastLog.Net uses fluent builder pattern to create the logger object easily.

## üíØFeatures
 **FastLog.Net features :**
 * **Supported Logging Events :**  
    * INFO  
    * NOTE  
    * TODO  
    * WARNING  
    * ALERT  
    * DEBUG  
    * ERROR  
    * EXCEPTION ‚Üí Specially designed for .Net [Exception](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception?view=net-7.0) class to keep all details with nice json format.
    * SYSTEM  
    * SECURITY  
    * CONSOLE ‚Üí Designed to log the "Console Output".  
 <br/>  
 
 * **Agents :** 
   * **Text File Agent** which supports both plain text and json format with ability to handle log file max size.  
 
   * **Colorized Console Agent** which also supports text and json output.  
 
   * **Beep Agent** (works only on Windows¬Æ OS) which is resposible to make [beep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.beep?view=net-7.0) sound from BIOS or system speaker with fully customizable event type.  
 
   * **Debug/Trace Agents** help you to log your events on [debug](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug?view=net-7.0) or [trace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.trace?view=net-7.0) system.  
 
   * **Run Process Agent** will run a specific process in "Noraml" or "As administrator" privileges ,  based on a specific or all events.  
 
   * **Method Execution Agent** will call a method in your code ,  based on a specific or all events.  
 
   * **Heavy Operation Simulator Agent** simulates an heavy IO bound operation (like email sending or http operation) , this agent is used for testing the FastLog.Net or create a delay intentionally between the agents.  
 
 > **Note**:  
All agents support Event Type filtering ,  so you can easily specify that your agent should be executed on which event type(s).  
For example: You can add a "Beep Agent" with "Exception" log event , so the beep agent will only execute on "Exceptions" not other logging events.  
 
 <br/>  
 
 * **Internal Events Logger:**
   * **FastLog.Net** has a powerful and structured internal logging system to log and monitor internal exceptions or event which occured in the library itself !  
  <br/>  
 
 * **Thread Safety:**
   * **FastLog.Net** has an internal queue list which is designed fully thread-safe , it's really not matter how many thread(s) call the logging methods simultaneously , it will get your request(s) and put in the queue and immediately release your thread ! Then process your logging request(s) in the background.

## ‚ùî How To Use
 ### Step 1 üëá  
 - Create the **Internal Logger** agent with fluent builder pattern :  
 
 ```csharp
 InternalLogger internalLogger = InternalLogger.Create()
                                               .UseJsonFormat()
                                               .SaveInternalEventsToFile(@"Logs\InternalEventsLog.log")
                                               .DeleteTheLogFileWhenExceededTheMaximumSizeOf(20)
                                               .PrintOnConsole();
 ```   
> **Note**:  
Internal logger agent is responsible for logging the events occured in the FastLog.Net internally (including exceptions).  
 
  ### Step 2 üëá  
 - Create the **Logger Configuration** with fluent builder pattern :  
 
 ```csharp
 ConfigManager loggerConfig = ConfigManager.Create()
                                           .WithLoggerName("FastLog.Net¬Æ Logger")
                                           .WithMaxEventsToKeepInMemory(1_000);
 ```   
 > **Warning**:  
There is "**RunAgentsInParallelMode**" feature you can use to run agent(s) in parallel , but in most cases it's **NOT** recommended because may have considerable negative impact on performance.  
 
   ### Step 3 üëá  
 - Create the **Logger** with fluent builder pattern :  
 
 ```csharp
 Logger fastLogger = Logger.Create()
                           .WithInternalLogger(internalLogger)
                           .WithConfiguration(loggerConfig)
                           .WithAgents()
 
 
 // Add a "Console Agent" with Json format.
                              .AddConsoleAgent()
                               .UseJsonFormat()
                              .BuildAgent()
 
 
 // Add a "Beep Agent".
                              .AddBeepAgent().BuildAgent()
 
 
 // Add a "Debug System Agent".
                              .AddDebugSystemAgent().BuildAgent()
 
 
 // Add a "TextFile Agent" with Json format and will be re-created when reached to 10 megabytes.
                              .AddTextFileAgent()
                               .UseJsonFormat()
                               .SaveLogToFile("Logs\\TestLog.json")
                               .DeleteTheLogFileWhenExceededTheMaximumSizeOf(10)
                              .BuildAgent()
 
 
// Add a "TextFile Agent" with Plain format and will be re-created when reached to 20 megabytes.
                              .AddTextFileAgent()
                               .SaveLogToFile("Logs\\TestLogPlain.txt")
                               .DeleteTheLogFileWhenExceededTheMaximumSizeOf(20)
                              .BuildAgent()
 
 
 // And Finally build the logger.
                            .BuildLogger();
 
 
 // Start the FastLog.Net engine in the background.
      fastLogger.StartLogger();

 ``` 

 ### Final Step üëá  
  - **FastLog.Net** is ready , just call a logging method from anywhere of your code :  
 
 ```csharp
_= fastLogger.LogInfo("This is test logging INFO event);
 
await fastLogger.LogException(new InvalidOperationException());
 
await fastLogger.LogException(new Exception("This is a test exception i want to throw !!"));
 
await fastLogger.LogSystem("The system is gonna be restarted !");
 ```   
      
 > **Warning**:  
 >Since the **FastLog.Net** uses the background engine to process the requested log event(s) , so we **MUST** await "**ProcessAllEventsInQueue()**" method until all request(s) in the queue to be processed before the app/service termination.

 ```csharp
 await ProcessAllEventsInQueue();
 ```

## ‚ùì How It Works

<br/>
 
## ‚ùå Limitations

- However the **FastLog.Net** is thread-safe BUT it is **NOT** recommended to build two or more agents with the same logging file , so this limitation applied to the FastLog.Net intentionally to prevent two or more agents write and manage the same logging file.

- The **FastLog.Net** queue has been limited to handle up to the **1,000,000** logging events at the **same time**.This limitation has been set to prevent uncontrolled memory usage.
